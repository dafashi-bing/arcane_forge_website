# Arcane Forge — Early Partner Update (25-12-09) 🚀

Hey everyone!

It’s been just about two weeks since we opened Arcane Forge to our early design partners — and wow, the feedback has already been incredibly helpful.

One thing that really stood out:

**Build the game *with* developers, not *for* them. Respect their vision, don’t overwrite it.**

Hearing that directly from early partners means a lot. That alignment is exactly what we hoped for.

## 🆕 This Week’s Update (High-Level)

We focused on documentation clarity and workflow polish. No bug fixes listed here — just user-facing improvements.

### 📄 Knowledge-Base Doc Versioning

A commonly requested feature: early partners wanted to safely iterate on docs and keep older drafts.

We now support **versioning** for knowledge-base documents to make iterative design smoother.

### 📚 Documentation Improvements (Ongoing)

We’ve started reorganizing and expanding our internal documentation — clearer guidance, more structured examples, and better explanations of how each module works.

These updates will feed directly into the [**Arcane Forge documentation site**](https://docs.arcaneforge.ai/), which is actively in development.

### 🎨 Online Image Generation (In Development)

Local image generation has been one of the biggest pain points for early testers — GPU compatibility varies a lot, and not everyone has the hardware to run heavier models.

We hear you.

We’re now prioritizing **online image generation**, allowing creators to generate visuals through our cloud infrastructure. This upgrade aims to give everyone a stable, consistent experience, regardless of their hardware setup.

We’ll share more details as the feature progresses.

## 🎯 Current Feature Priorities

To keep everyone aligned, here’s what the team is actively focusing on right now:

1. **Online Image Generation** – improving stability and accessibility  
2. **Code Generation Enhancements** – expanding capability and improving reliability  

Both priorities are shaped directly by early partner feedback.

## 🙏 Thanks again

Thank you to everyone who's been testing, giving feedback, and sharing your honest thoughts.

This early partner phase is shaping Arcane Forge in real time, and we’re moving quickly because of your input.

More updates soon — and if you're an early design partner reading this, please keep the feedback coming ❤️
