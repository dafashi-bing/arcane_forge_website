# Arcane Forge Early Release

Hey everyone — just a quick update I’ve been wanting to share for a *long* time:

**Arcane Forge's early-release MVP is finally done.**<br />
Not perfect, not final… but real, working, and honestly something I wish I had 10 years ago.

## **A quick personal story**

I’ve always wanted to make games.  
The problem? Even though I’m a decent software engineer… I’m **not** an artist, sound designer, composer, or a Unity/Unreal wizard.

Back at VPGame, we even had frontend, backend, and some pretty decent artists — and still couldn’t ship a “real” game. The gap between *coding ability* and *actual game production* is huge.

Funny enough, one of our team members later took our rough prototype to Tencent, and with a full production pipeline behind it, it eventually became a pretty successful title — [LOLE](https://lole.qq.com/main.html). Seeing our tiny prototype side by side with the final game really highlighted something for me: the idea wasn’t the issue — the production muscle was.

As AI started improving, I kept thinking:

> *“If AI ever gets good enough, maybe I can finally build the game in my mind.”*

But most AI tools only generate toy demos. Those one-prompt-one-game apps are fun to watch, but they can’t build **your** game.

AAA studios, meanwhile, hire full AI teams and get 20× productivity boosts.  
Small studios can’t replicate that — the cost is impossible.

miHoYo’s founder Cai Haoyu recently predicted that the future of gaming will split into two extremes: a tiny number of ultra-high-quality AAA productions, and a massive long tail of AI-generated games created by everyday hobbyists. He even said that 99% of hobbyists will be able to make games “on a whim.”

That idea really resonated with me.

So if 99% of future games are going to be AI-powered, someone has to build the foundation that makes those games possible.

Around the same time, several AAA studios tried to recruit me to build their internal ML platforms. But instead of helping one studio, I realized:

> **I’d rather build an AI platform that *every* creator can use — so anyone can build the game in their mind.**

That’s how Arcane Forge was born.

## **A quick note on our philosophy (important)**

One thing I really want to emphasize:

**Arcane Forge is *not* here to replace artists, designers, or developers.**

If that were my goal, I’d just build another “AI makes a random game for you” toy — which isn’t helpful for anyone trying to ship a real project.

Our mission is the opposite:

> **Arcane Forge helps you build the game *you* want — not the game the AI wants.**

The AI shouldn’t take over your vision.<br />
It shouldn’t overwrite your ideas.<br />
It should *respect* your direction and accelerate your creativity.

Yes — we could build a fully automated agent.  
But today, the mission is simple:

> **Help creators shape their games faster, without losing their voice.**  
> Build the game in your mind — not a random game.

## **So… what does Arcane Forge actually do? (super short version)**

Arcane Forge gives you:

* **Game-aware AI helpers** for design, code, art, sound, and analytics  
* **Cherry-picked models** tuned specifically for game development  
* A **unified workspace** that connects GDD → code → assets → iteration  
* Tools that make prototyping and exploring ideas *way* easier  

If you don’t have a full team, Arcane Forge becomes your team.  
If you do have a team, it becomes your multiplier.

## **Our tiny showcase games (built fast on purpose)**

We’ve also been making [small themed showcase games](https://games.arcaneforge.ai/games) using Arcane Forge — each version built **in under a day**.

They’re not polished. They’re not high-quality.  
And that’s the point.

They exist to show what's possible when you remove friction and let AI help you move quickly.

We’re now looking for **early design partners** who want early access, want to collaborate with us, and want to help shape where this platform goes.

If that’s you, reach out. ❤️

## **What’s next**

We’ll keep posting updates every 1–2 weeks about:

* new features  
* game jams  
* new demos  
* roadmap milestones  
* behind-the-scenes progress  

This is just the beginning — but it’s a big step.

Thanks for following along.<br />
More soon. 🙏
