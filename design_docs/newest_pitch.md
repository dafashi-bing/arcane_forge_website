# ================================================

```
THE PROBLEM

AI tools could speed up dev tasks by ~20x in AAA studios.
But AI results are poor and only work for AI experts.
AI experts are expensive.
“One-prompt-one-game” tools look magical but are random and uncontrollable.

MARKET CONTEXT
11.1M game developers worldwide
16k+ game dev companies in the US

90% tried AI
70% gave up (poor results, steep learning curve)

<1% of studios can afford a full-scale AI team
```

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 3 — THE SOLUTION**

# ================================================

```
THE SOLUTION

Problem: Making a real game is costly
→ Arcane Forge speeds dev by ~20x with AI tools.

Problem: AI results are poor and require AI experts
→ Easy-to-use AI tools with AI Helper.
→ Cherry-picked models and tools curated for game dev.

Problem: AI experts are expensive
→ We abstract all AI stacks: models, tuning, infra, workflows.

Problem: “One-prompt-one-game” is random & uncontrollable
→ We follow real game dev best practices:
   AI drafts → users review → controlled iteration.

# **SLIDE 12 — EARLY PILOTS & LEARNINGS (1)**

# ================================================

```
EARLY PILOTS

10 trial studios in 3 days (from one social post)
8 requested concrete tasks (images, story, code)
Avg turnaround: 2 hours (vs 3 days previously)
2 tier-1 teams (ex-NetEase, ex-ByteDance)
10/10 trials requested continued access
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 13 — EARLY PILOTS & LEARNINGS (2)**

# ================================================

```
WHAT WE LEARNED

- Big knowledge gap: game dev vs AI dev
- Tools are fragmented across many places
- One-prompt-one-anything doesn't fit production pipelines

HOW THIS SHAPED MVP
- Game-design-aware & software-design-aware AI
- Guided AI setup (recommended models/settings)
- Connect Design → Code → Assets → Analytics → Iteration
  into one workspace
```

# **SLIDE 16 — GO-TO-MARKET PLAN**

# ================================================

```
GTM PLAN

WHO WE TARGET
- Indie devs and small teams
- Want to ship fast and stand out

CHANNELS
1. Short-video content & social posts
2. Arcane Forge Game Jams (~$10k prize)

WHY THIS WORKS
- Low CAC, global reach
- Indie teams are active in game jams
- Great early-stage sharpening before moving upmarket
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 17 — GTM: SHORT VIDEO & SOCIAL MEDIA**

# ================================================

```
GTM: SHORT VIDEO & SOCIAL MEDIA

STRATEGY
- Consistent short videos/posts:
  “Here’s the game we built in a week with Arcane Forge.”

WHY IT WORKS
- Devs discover tools through social media
- Competitors see big spikes (e.g., Gambo.ai)

FUNNEL
Top:    views, likes, reposts
Middle: clicks → signups
Bottom: active projects finished
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 18 — GTM: ARCANE FORGE GAME JAMS**

# ================================================

```
GTM: ARCANE FORGE GAME JAMS

FORMAT
- Online Game Jam every quarter
- Timeboxed (e.g., 1 week)
- ~$10k prize pool
- Awards: Best AI game, Most creative, Best use of AF, etc.

WHY IT WORKS
- Indie teams actively join jams
- Typical prizes are small → $10k is a strong draw
- AI fits short timeboxed builds

WHAT IT DRIVES
- High-intent users (must build with AF)
- Content for portfolio and ads
- Recurring community + feedback loop
```

# **SLIDE 19 — GAME-SPECIFIC AI PLATFORM**

# ================================================

```
GAME-SPECIFIC AI PLATFORM (Positioning)

Axes:
- Generic ↔ Game Specific
- Point Tool ↔ All-in-One

Arcane Forge sits in: Game Specific + All-in-One
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 20 — AI GAME BUILDERS (LIMITATIONS)**

# ================================================

```
AI GAME BUILDERS — GREAT FOR CONTENT, BAD FOR PRODUCTION

Strengths:
- One-prompt playable snippets
- Good for short-form content & ad creatives

Limitations:
- No real project structure
- Cannot scale into maintainable games
- Poor control over systems (balance, economy)
- Weak team workflow
- Mostly solo-creator toys

Arcane Forge:
- Game-design-aware platform for teams building long-lived games
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 21 — GAME-SPECIFIC TOOLS (LIMITATIONS)**

# ================================================

```
GAME-SPECIFIC AI TOOLS — POWERFUL SLICES, NO PIPELINE

Examples: Ludo.ai, Inworld, modl.ai, Holopix

Limitations:
- Each tool handles one slice
- Lots of manual glue work
- No shared game model across tools
- Teams + long-running games don’t scale

Arcane Forge:
- Unifies GDD → Assets → Code → Iteration in one workspace
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 22 — GENERIC AI MODELS (LIMITATIONS)**

# ================================================

```
GENERIC AI MODELS — GREAT INGREDIENTS, NO GAME

Examples: Midjourney, Civitai, LLMs, Cursor

Limitations:
- Not game-aware
- Outputs aren’t buildable without rewriting specs
- Art, text, code separated in chat logs
- Single-user tools → weak team pipeline

Arcane Forge:
- Adds a game-design-aware brain inside a real pipeline
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 23 — GENERIC AI INFRA**

# ================================================

```
GENERIC AI INFRA — POWERFUL CLOUDS, DIY EVERYTHING ELSE

Examples: AWS, GCP, Azure, Databricks

Limitations:
- Zero game context
- Studios must build their own tools & pipelines
- Heavy engineering lift
- Multi-year investment for internal platform

Arcane Forge:
- Game-specific AI layer built on top of generic clouds
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 24 — IMAGE GENERATION (COMPETITOR LANDSCAPE)**

# ================================================

```
IMAGE GENERATION — COMPETITOR LANDSCAPE

Generic Tools:
- OpenAI / Midjourney / NanoBanana
- Civitai / HuggingFace

Issues:
- Limited style control for game dev
- Tons of Photoshop cleanup
- 10k+ models: overwhelming choice
- Typical workflow:
  Generate → dislike → repeat
```

---

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 25 — ARCANE FORGE IMAGE GENERATION**

ARCANE FORGE IMAGE GEN APPROACH

- Cherry-picked models & tools optimized for game dev
- Easy-to-use tools with AI Helper guidance

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 26 — CLASSIC CLOUD MODEL**

# ================================================

```
CLASSIC CLOUD MODEL — SUBSCRIPTION + PAY-AS-YOU-GO

- Cloud compute cost × 2.5 (≈60% margin)
- Auto-adjusts with GPU spot price

PLANS
Start:  $49/seat → Basic usage, community help
Pro:    $79/seat → More usage, priority chat support
Studio: $99/seat → Unlimited seats, enterprise features
```

# ================================================

# **SLIDE 28 — LONG-TERM VISION (2)**

# ================================================

```
LONG-TERM VISION (2)

- Team collaboration: workspaces, roles, shared assets
- Bring-your-own-model/data (LoRAs, fine-tuning)
- In-game AI (NPCs, dynamic dialogue)
- Autonomous AI (auto-balance, auto-iteration)
- Ecosystem: engine SDKs, plugins, workflows
```
