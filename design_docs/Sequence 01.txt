00:00:00:37 - 00:00:03:01
Hey everyone, this is being from ArkaneForge AI.

00:00:03:01 - 00:00:06:05
Today I'm excited to walk youthrough our MVP demo,

00:00:06:19 - 00:00:10:28
a platform that helps game studiosand indie developers design, build,

00:00:10:28 - 00:00:13:28
and iterate gamesfaster with the help of our AI.

00:00:14:56 - 00:00:16:12
Let's start from the beginning.

00:00:16:12 - 00:00:17:47
The game designer system.

00:00:17:47 - 00:00:19:48
Here, you can simply start a new project.

00:00:19:48 - 00:00:22:08
Describewhat kind of game you want to make.

00:00:22:08 - 00:00:24:55
Say I top down the roguelike shooter,and already

00:00:24:55 - 00:00:27:55
I will walk you through the entire designprocess.

00:00:28:28 - 00:00:31:51
It follows through on game designpatterns, asks the right questions,

00:00:32:04 - 00:00:35:20
and helps you organize your ideasinto a structured game

00:00:35:20 - 00:00:38:20
design document.

00:00:40:06 - 00:00:41:42
Once you are happy with your design,

00:00:41:42 - 00:00:45:19
you can save it to your project knowledgebase for future iteration, team

00:00:45:19 - 00:00:48:25
collaborationor directly into code generation.

00:00:49:58 - 00:00:52:58
Now that we have a design, it'stime to move into development.

00:00:53:09 - 00:00:56:09
Here we use the Flame Slayer game engine.

00:00:57:30 - 00:00:59:43
To get good code generation quality.

00:00:59:43 - 00:01:02:51
We install flameMCP, our model context protocol.

00:01:03:23 - 00:01:06:01
It helps anyAI coding assistant understand

00:01:06:01 - 00:01:09:03
the flame frameworkand bring optimal solution to your game.

00:01:10:04 - 00:01:12:09
You can take your design doginto your favorite

00:01:12:09 - 00:01:15:09
AI IDs and have them generate game code.

00:01:15:18 - 00:01:19:38
We've tested this with multipleAI coding agents, and we're same MCP.

00:01:19:39 - 00:01:22:39
The code generationbecomes a lot more reliable.

00:01:23:00 - 00:01:25:30
We'll continue expandingwith additional MSPs

00:01:25:30 - 00:01:27:45
for other frameworks in the future.

00:01:27:45 - 00:01:32:04
This way, your AI IDs can performjust as efficiently across

00:01:32:04 - 00:01:35:04
whichever SDK you choose to work with.

00:01:37:37 - 00:01:38:04
All right,

00:01:38:04 - 00:01:41:22
let's talk about the creative sideas a generation, one of the most time

00:01:41:22 - 00:01:45:09
consuming parts of game developmentthat we wanted to simplify dramatically.

00:01:46:19 - 00:01:49:40
From your design document, Arkham Forgecan automatically detect

00:01:49:40 - 00:01:52:42
what types of assets you needand generate them for you.

00:01:52:58 - 00:01:55:44
No need to manually describeevery single element.

00:01:55:44 - 00:01:58:44
The AI already understandthe context of the design

00:02:00:25 - 00:02:03:19
AI can forge, analyzesthe description, and generates

00:02:03:19 - 00:02:07:10
a full list of prompts for each assetbehind the scene, and matches

00:02:07:10 - 00:02:09:34
the right imagegeneration model for each task.

00:02:09:34 - 00:02:13:11
Whether you are going for pixel art,hand-drawn or 3D rendered styles,

00:02:14:52 - 00:02:17:38
we know that many game developersaren't AI researchers,

00:02:17:38 - 00:02:20:43
and tuning promptsand parameters can be very intimidating.

00:02:21:03 - 00:02:24:19
That's why we built a AI model recommenderand the prompt helper.

00:02:24:48 - 00:02:26:13
The AI doesn't just tell you

00:02:26:13 - 00:02:30:34
what models to use, it explainswhy it's a good fit and helps you iterate.

00:02:30:34 - 00:02:31:57
Visualize your conversation.

00:02:33:01 - 00:02:35:11
Sometimes the first generationisn't perfect.

00:02:35:11 - 00:02:40:03
Maybe colors clashed with your UIor styles are inconsistent across assets.

00:02:40:37 - 00:02:41:58
You can provide your comments

00:02:41:58 - 00:02:45:49
on what you like and don't like onprevious generations, and asking for its

00:02:45:50 - 00:02:49:39
AI can automatically reviewyour asset patch and suggest improvements.

00:02:58:39 - 00:03:00:48
Once the assets are generated,you can preview

00:03:00:48 - 00:03:04:44
multiple versions, compare themside by side, and mark your favorites.

00:03:05:09 - 00:03:08:27
Those selected imagesare automatically typed for export

00:03:08:47 - 00:03:11:47
and readyto drop directly into your project folder.

00:03:13:26 - 00:03:15:30
Audio is another key element of the game.

00:03:15:30 - 00:03:18:03
From sound effectsto ambient background music,

00:03:18:03 - 00:03:20:54
you can generate everythingdirectly from your design document.

00:03:20:54 - 00:03:25:06
The AI read descriptionslike fireball, attack or Victory scene

00:03:25:06 - 00:03:26:24
and suggest appropriate sounds.

00:03:26:24 - 00:03:31:43
Generation props. For.

00:03:37:24 - 00:03:40:24
Your show.

00:03:43:37 - 00:03:46:39
And of course, just like visuals,you can favorite your best takes.

00:03:46:44 - 00:03:49:15
Download them and import themstraight into your project.

00:04:03:45 - 00:04:06:21
With all these features combined, assetgeneration

00:04:06:21 - 00:04:09:59
becomes a iterative creative process,not a technical.

00:04:10:21 - 00:04:13:55
You stay focused on designand storytelling while our team force

00:04:13:55 - 00:04:16:55
and also the AI production details.

00:04:17:56 - 00:04:18:53
With design code

00:04:18:53 - 00:04:21:53
and assets in place,we now have our first playable build.

00:04:21:57 - 00:04:25:17
In version one, we kept thingssimple five heroes in different shapes,

00:04:25:38 - 00:04:29:07
a basic shop system, two types of enemies,and around ten items.

00:04:29:36 - 00:04:32:25
The goal is to survivethrough five waves of enemies.

00:04:32:25 - 00:04:36:10
It's not perfect, but it's a startand it shows people what game

00:04:36:10 - 00:04:39:10
we're building.

00:04:54:13 - 00:04:57:13
So so.

00:05:00:19 - 00:05:02:04
No game is great on the first try,

00:05:02:04 - 00:05:05:07
and that's whyiteration is a huge part of Arkham Forge.

00:05:06:21 - 00:05:09:03
Our feedback system letsyou connect to in-game data

00:05:09:03 - 00:05:12:03
or player feedbackdirectly to your design environment.

00:05:12:09 - 00:05:15:37
You can ask AI questionslike is the difficulty curve too steep?

00:05:15:59 - 00:05:19:39
Or which levels have the highest drop offrate, and get analysis

00:05:19:39 - 00:05:21:30
and suggestions back instantly.

00:05:22:55 - 00:05:25:33
The systemcan process both qualitative comments

00:05:25:33 - 00:05:30:05
and quantitative metrics like wing rates,session time or stage completion ratio,

00:05:30:23 - 00:05:33:23
and transform them into actionableinsights.

00:05:33:55 - 00:05:37:12
The AI not only answers your questions,but provides context.

00:05:37:33 - 00:05:40:15
It can explain why certain patternsmight emerge,

00:05:40:15 - 00:05:44:51
highlight anomalies in player behavior,and even visualize difficulty spikes

00:05:44:51 - 00:05:47:51
or engagementdrops right inside your own forex space.

00:05:47:51 - 00:05:51:00
This makes it easy to see at a glancewhat's working

00:05:51:00 - 00:05:53:07
and what needs to be tuning.

00:05:53:07 - 00:05:56:13
The AI then writes a Delta gamedesign document summarizing

00:05:56:13 - 00:05:58:06
what should be improved next.

00:05:58:06 - 00:06:01:44
It captures these iterationsso that you can trace the evolution

00:06:01:44 - 00:06:04:44
of your game's design decisions.

00:06:05:06 - 00:06:07:30
Beyond that,we have AI driven improvement design.

00:06:07:30 - 00:06:11:38
Our AI group's relatedfeedback identifies patterns and proposed

00:06:11:38 - 00:06:14:43
potential mutations,which are creative variations

00:06:14:43 - 00:06:17:43
or next steps ideasfor the next iteration.

00:06:17:54 - 00:06:21:43
For instance, if players keep mentioningthat the difficulty curve is too steep,

00:06:22:03 - 00:06:23:31
the system will suggest tuning

00:06:23:31 - 00:06:27:01
and we can fix or introducenew mechanisms to make game easier.

00:06:27:52 - 00:06:31:19
You can review, edit, or addyour own ideas before generating

00:06:31:19 - 00:06:34:48
the next iteration documentand saving it to your knowledge base.

00:06:35:36 - 00:06:38:40
Each iterationbuilds upon the previous one, turning your

00:06:38:40 - 00:06:42:41
feedback loop into a true co-creationprocess between you and the AI.

00:06:54:07 - 00:06:56:49
Here's where the magic happensin version two.

00:06:56:49 - 00:07:00:57
After processing the feedback,we added more heroes, two more game modes,

00:07:01:10 - 00:07:05:06
and the list modeand OHV mode improved the UI and balanced

00:07:05:06 - 00:07:08:54
the game waste by introducing power updrops and new enemy types that change

00:07:08:54 - 00:07:10:30
how each rank feels.

00:07:10:30 - 00:07:14:22
We also refined progression, pacing,and adjusted the in-game economy

00:07:14:40 - 00:07:17:25
so that the game is less brokenand more playable.

00:07:17:25 - 00:07:21:00
These changes made versiontwo feel much more polished and enjoyable

00:07:21:00 - 00:07:24:00
to play.

00:07:32:40 - 00:07:35:04
Then in version three,we pushed even further

00:07:35:04 - 00:07:38:22
a cleaner interface, new abilities, around20 new items,

00:07:38:36 - 00:07:41:36
and a wide range of enemieswith unique attack patterns.

00:07:42:03 - 00:07:45:52
We introduced new upgradesfor the heroes, expanded the list mode

00:07:46:17 - 00:07:50:33
and improved animations and hit feedbacksfor more satisfying combat experience.

00:07:51:09 - 00:07:54:09
You will even see new mechanismslike the wingman system,

00:07:54:21 - 00:07:57:21
where sidekicks can assistyou during battles, creating

00:07:57:21 - 00:08:01:10
more dynamic, strategicand unpredictable gameplay moments.

00:08:02:51 - 00:08:03:30
And that's how our

00:08:03:30 - 00:08:07:53
MVP in action from concept to code, fromart to iteration, Arkham

00:08:07:53 - 00:08:11:20
Forge connects every part of game creationwith AI systems.

00:08:11:56 - 00:08:15:07
We are building toolsthat large gameplay studios focus less on,

00:08:15:07 - 00:08:18:41
loading complicated AI setupsand more on creative directions.

00:08:19:31 - 00:08:20:47
Thank you for watching!

00:08:20:47 - 00:08:24:16
If you are a game studio or developerinterested in trying Arkham Forge

00:08:24:25 - 00:08:27:25
or partnering with us,feel free to reach out.

00:08:27:46 - 00:08:29:00
Let's build the game in your mind.
