     * Game-friendly aspect ratios and export formats

2. **Music & Sound**

## Section 4 – “How Arcane Forge fits into your workflow”

**Goal:** Mirror “understands your workflow” in a multi-engine context.

**Title:**

> How Arcane Forge fits into your workflow

**Layout:**

Three horizontal steps (with icons):

1. **Plan & Explore**

   * “Use the game assistant to outline mechanics, content and world ideas. Quickly generate concept art and temp music for internal pitches and prototypes.”

2. **Produce Assets & Content**

   * “Create batches of art, audio and narrative variations. Keep everything organized by project instead of scattered across tools and chats.”

3. **Integrate & Iterate**

   * “Export assets into your engine of choice and connect runtime hooks as needed. Use AI to help you iterate instead of manually redoing everything.”

Short note below:

> Engine-agnostic: works alongside Unity, Unreal, Godot and custom engines via exports and SDKs.

## Section 5 – “Why Arcane Forge” (Differentiation)

**Goal:** Your “Why choose Druid” equivalent, focused on *why you vs other AI tools*.

**Title:**

> Why teams choose Arcane Forge

**Bullets (3–4):**

* **Game-specific, not generic AI**
  Workflows, prompts and models are curated for game production, not generic office tasks.

* **One hub instead of many tools**
  Design, assets, assistants and upcoming analytics live in one place, so your team isn’t juggling random scripts and accounts.

* **No in-house AI team required**
  We handle the model and infra complexity. You focus on building games; Arcane Forge handles the AI plumbing.

* **Built to grow with your studio**
  Start with a single project and scale up to more titles, teams and custom models over time.
